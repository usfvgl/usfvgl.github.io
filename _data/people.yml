    about: |
      Alark Joshi works on data visualization projects for improved
      neurosurgical planning and treatment. His research focuses on
      developing and evaluating the ability of novel visualization
      techniques to communicate information for effective decision
      making and discovery. His work has led to novel visualization
      techniques in fields as diverse as computational fluid dynamics,
      atmospheric physics, medical imaging and cell biology. Alark
      received his PhD from the University of Maryland, was a
      Postdoctoral Associate at Yale University, and most recently a
      professor at Boise State University.

      <h1>About VGL</h1>

      <p>The <strong class="has-text-vgl-primary">Visualization and Graphics Lab (VGL)</strong> was founded in November 2015 to bring together faculty and students to discuss and collaborate on research in the data visualization and graphics fields. Our regular lab meetings are open to all students, faculty, and staff at USF as well as interested members of the public.</p>

      <h2>Past Events</h2>

      <p>VGL occasionally hosts, sponsors, or helps organize various on-campus and off-campus events. These can be found archived below.</p>

      <h4>Pedagogy of Data Visualization Workshop (PDVW)</h4>

      <p>The pedagogy of data visualization is becoming increasingly important as data visualization techniques and tools proliferate. This workshop creates a community of practice that supports each other as they learn to be better teachers in their respective classrooms.</p>

      <p>This half-day interactive workshop was held in conjunction with IEEE VIS in 2016 and 2017.</p>

      <h4>Data Visualization Speaker Series (DVSS)</h4>

      <p>This speaker series was established in Spring 2014 as an interdisciplinary effort by professors Scott Murray in Design and Alark Joshi and Sophie Engle in Computer Science. Events in this series were open to all faculty, staff, students, alumni of USF, and the general public.</p>

      <p>This speaker series was generously supported by the <a href="https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/about">Office of the Dean in the College of Arts and Sciences</a> at the University of San Francisco, and advertised to the public via the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/visualizemydata/">Data Visualization Group in the Bay Area</a> meetup.</p>

      <h4>Student Data Visualization Contest</h4>

      <p>The goal of this contest was to encourage students to produce an interactive web-based visualization inline with the University's mission to <q>change the world from here</q>. The contest was open to all students and judged by a four-person panel. The first place winner received a Wacom Bamboo Create Pen and Touch Tablet, and two honorable mentions received an Apple iPod Shuffle and Roku LT Streaming Player.</p>

      <p>The contest was generously supported by the <a href="https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/about">Office of the Dean in the College of Arts and Sciences</a> at the University of San Francisco.</p>

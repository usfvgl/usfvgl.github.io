<p>The <strong class="usf-green">Data Visualization Speaker Series (DVSS)</strong> was established in Spring 2014 as an interdisciplinary effort by professors Scott Murray in Design and Alark Joshi and Sophie Engle in Computer Science. Events in this series are open to all faculty, staff, students, and alumni of USF and are open to the public.</p>

abstract : |
  <p>Over the last few years, the security industry has been leapfrogged in innovation by both attackers and advances in the greater information technology landscape. Incremental changes in how we defend networks and data are no longer good enough to keep up with the pace of change. We are losing ground more rapidly than ever before.</p>

  <p>The Big Data movement, when paired with visualization, gives the security industry a chance to get back to innovating and get ahead of the pace of change. Our ability to explore data in a meaningful way is critical to discovering, predicting, and ultimately detecting advanced threats in the future. The addition to new interfaces and 3D exploration models provide researchers with additional techniques to examine data and tell meaningful security stories.</p>

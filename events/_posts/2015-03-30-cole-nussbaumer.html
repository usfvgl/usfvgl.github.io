  <p>Cole Nussbaumer tells stories with data. She teaches others how to do it,
  too. Come see a condensed overview of the lessons Cole covers in her popular
  storytelling with data workshops for organizations like Adobe, Genentech,
  Mastercard, Target, the World Bank, and Google. You'll leave the session
  inspired and armed with some practical lessons that will set you up for
  success for telling your stories with data.</p>

  <p>Cole Nussbaumer tells stories with data. Her skills have been honed by over
  a decade in analytical roles in banking, private equity, and most recently as
  a manger on the People Analytics team at Google, where she used a data-driven
  approach to ensure that Google attracted and retained great people and that
  the organization was best aligned to meet business needs. Cole specializes in
  the effective display of quantitative information and traveled to Google
  offices around the world to teach her course on data visualization.</p>

  <p>Cole is author of <em>Storytelling With Data: A Data Visualization Guide for Business Professionals</em> (Wiley, to be released Fall 2015), writes the popular blog,
  <a href="http://www.storytellingwithdata.com">www.storytellingwithdata.com</a>
  and delivers presentations and workshops for companies and philanthropic organizations on the topic of telling a compelling story with data. She is an adjunct faculty member at MICA, where she teaches Introduction to Information Visualization.</p>

  <p>Cole has a BS in Applied Math and an MBA, both from the University of
  Washington. When she isn't working on her consulting work with storytelling
  with data, Cole enjoys cooking, traveling, and undertaking San Francisco
  adventures with her husband and sons.</p>
abstract : |
  <p>It's surprisingly easy to make a confusing graph. No one sets out with
  that purpose, but it happens frequently&mdash;across all industries and by
  all sorts of well-intending people.</p>

  <p>One way to position yourself for success in data visualization and
  communicating with data is to never simply show data, but rather to tell a
  story with data. ​Being able to tell stories with data is a critical skill in
  our world of ever increasing data and desire for data-driven decision making.
  An effective data story can mean the difference between success and failure
  when it comes to communicating the findings of your study, raising money for
  your non-profit, presenting to your board, or simply getting your point across
  to your audience.</p>

abstract : |
  <p>In this talk, Andy will explore the breadth and depth of thinking in
  data visualization. He will take a horizontal look at the many different
  skill sets, attributes and disciplines that make up the craft of
  visualization designer, focusing on the distinct scientific and artistic
  sensibilities. Taking a vertical view, Andy will then dive in to the
  depths and nuances of one particular perspective of data-driven design
  thinking.</p>

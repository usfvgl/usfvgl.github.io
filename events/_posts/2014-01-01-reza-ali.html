profile  : |
  <p>Reza is a computational designer &amp; creative engineer. He uses code
  to express himself, and creates tools and libraries to help others create.
  He is the author of ofxUI, one of the most popular add-ons for
  openFrameworks (an arts-engineering toolkit). Though his works is highly
  visual, he is interested in the ideas and implications of his tools,
  works, and methodology. As an artist & engineer he is deeply interested
  in the feedback cycle that occurs when customs tools are written to
  accomplish an artwork, and how those tools can enable artworks to go
  beyond what the artist had originally envisioned. Reza is excited to find
  those happy accidents, beautiful moments of interaction and magic that
  comes with making something novel with technology. He hopes to change the
  world by making a difference in how people use technology, design products
  and experience new media art and entertainment.</p>

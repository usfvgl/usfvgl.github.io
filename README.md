# Visualization and Graphics Lab

This is the website repository for the **Visualization and Graphics Lab (VGL)** at the [**University of San Francisco**](http://www.usfca.edu/). 

## Setup

Github Pages uses an [older version](https://pages.github.com/versions/) of `jekyll`, so I recommend you follow the install steps at:

<https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/>

Once installed, you can generate the site locally with:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
```

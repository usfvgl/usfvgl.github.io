<p>The <a href="http://cs.usfca.edu/index.html">Department of Computer Science</a> is now hiring for two Assistant Professor positions: a <a href="https://www.usfjobs.com/postings/11490">tenure-track position</a> (heavier research load) and a <a href="https://www.usfjobs.com/postings/11491">full-time renewable position</a> (heavier teaching load). All CS sub-disciplines will be considered!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/usfcs">@USFCS</a> department is a diverse and growing community with 10 full-time faculty members, over 200 undergraduate CS majors, and over 50 masters students. While we are growing, the CS department maintains small class sizes with 30 or fewer students, project-based learning, and a high degree of student-teacher interaction. Several faculty members are NSF funded and collaborate with institutions in Silicon Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
